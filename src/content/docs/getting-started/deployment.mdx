## Hydrogen app

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Oxygen">
    You can use [Oxygen](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/deployments/oxygen-runtime) to deploy your Hydrogen app for free using the Shopify's
    official hosting solution. If you have added the Hydrogen channel to your
    Shopify store and if you want to deploy your app to Oxygen, read the
    official [Shopify
    guide](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/getting-started#step-3-install-the-hydrogen-channel).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vercel">
    You can use [Vercel](http://vercel.com/) to deploy your Hydrogen app to their
    global edge network with zero configuration. This guide includes
    instructions for deploying to Vercel through the website UI or Vercel's CLI.

    **Website UI Deployment**

    1. Push your code to your online Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket).
    2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.
    3. Vercel will automatically detect Remix and configure the right settings.
    4. Copy paste your environment variables.
    5. Your application is deployed!

    After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/preview-deployments), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly “main”) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#production).

    **CLI Deployment**

    1. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and run `vercel` to deploy.

      ```bash
      npm install -g vercel
      vercel
      ```

    2. Vercel will automatically detect Remix and configure the right settings.
    3. When asked `Want to override the settings? [y/N]`, choose `N`.
    4. Your application is now deployed, but still need to configure your environment variables using the Vercel website UI.
