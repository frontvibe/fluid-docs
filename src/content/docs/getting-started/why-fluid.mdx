title: Why Fluid?
---

Going headless is a hot-topic for e-commerce brands. It's the perfect
solution if you need a fully customized storefront or if you need to integrate external solutions.
But the industry lacks for solid tools to make the transition to headless easier.

The headless ecosystem misses a starting point like [Dawn](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/dawn),
(Shopify's reference theme for native Liquid projects). Fluid is highly inspired by
Dawn. You can add your color schemes, fonts and easily customize the theme to suit your design needs.
If you're interested in learning more about Dawn's design, you can read the following [article](https://ux.shopify.com/next-generation-theme-design-5aae94f6d44c).

Fluid is architectured around a set of pre-built sections that make it easy for
developers and content editors to build their own custom e-commerce experiences without having
to start from scratch.

By providing this theme, we aim to reduce the time to market and make the
transition to headless commerce more accessible. The theme is flexible and
can be adapted to fit a variety of e-commerce needs and usecases.
