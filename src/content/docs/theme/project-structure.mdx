## Files and directories

Fluid is separated between the Hydrogen app `app/` and the Sanity Studio `studio/`.

Both the Hydrogen app and the Sanity Studio have their own dependencies with dedicated `package.json` and `node_modules`.
You need to install the dependencies in both projects.

The Hydrogen app follows the [Remix file conventions](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/routes). You can learn more about the Hydrogen project structure [here](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/project-structure).

The Sanity studio project structure follows Sanity's [best practices](https://www.sanity.io/docs/project-structure).
