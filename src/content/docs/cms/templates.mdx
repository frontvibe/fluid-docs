title: Using Templates
---

You can create templates for your collections and products.

Similar to Shopify Liquid templates, you can use templates to display content in multiple collections or products at the same time.
This can be very useful if you have a Shopify store with a large number of collections and products.

A template is basically a list of sections that you can add to your collections or products.
You can choose one template as your default template and it will be used for all your collections and products that don't have a template attached.
